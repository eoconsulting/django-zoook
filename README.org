* Zoook

This is a fork of the Django part of Zoook. This is what the
developers have to say about Zoook:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Zoook is e-commerce OpenERP App without connector. Forget connectors
and errors.
#+END_QUOTE

We forked this package to provide better packaging facilities to this
module, bugfixing, and new features.

This sources are available in https://github.com/eoconsulting/django-zoook

The OpenERP module part is in https://github.com/eoconsulting/openerp-esale
